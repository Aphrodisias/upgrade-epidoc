            <p n="a 15">a. l. 15, the first letter is, I believe, a <term>delta</term>, but it may be a cutter's error for <term>lambda</term>, since <foreign xml:lang="grc">λελυμ</foreign>- is so obvious a possibility, as many colleagues have remarked to me.</p>
            <p>a. ll. 9, 10, 14, what survives of the last letter before the break is consonant with <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γ, Ε, Ζ, Ξ, Π, Σ, Τ</foreign>, and the letter in the same position in l.18 may be so too.
</p>
            <p>b. l. 1, the base of an upright is visible at the point of the break; <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γ, Η, Κ, Μ, Ν, Π, Ρ, Τ</foreign> are possible.</p>
            <p>b. l. 2, what survives before the break is consonant with <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ε, Ζ, Ξ, Σ</foreign>; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ σ<gap reason="lost" unit="character" extent="unknown"/>
               </foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπισ<supplied reason="lost">τολ-</supplied>
               </foreign> are both possible.
</p>
            <p>b. l. 3, the lower part of an upright survives at the point of the break, but the word can only be from the middle participle of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξηγεῖσθαι</foreign>.</p>
            <p>b. l. 4, it would be possible to fit <foreign xml:lang="grc">κα<supplied reason="lost">ὶ ἡμεῖς φυλάττομεν</supplied>
               </foreign> into the space; cf. <ref type="inscription" n="517" target="080036.xml"/>, l. 12; <ref type="inscription" n="525" target="080114.xml"/>, l. 12.</p>
            <p>b. l. 5, the letters <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΠΡΟΚΑΛΣΕΠΤ</foreign> have been erased here but can still be read in a cross light—presumably the designer realized belatedly that the space was needed for the valediction.</p>
            <p>b. l. 6, of the last letter before the break only a lower serif survives, but it shows conclusively that the letter was <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δ, Ε, Ζ, Ξ</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σ</foreign>, and in the context <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ε</foreign> alone is possible; between this serif and the end of the break there is no room for more than 5-6 letters.</p>

            <p>a. At the time of discovery it was expected that more of the text would be found quite soon, and that further publication would be needed; but no additional pieces of the stone have come to light, and it is improbable now that they will do so in the foreseeable future. In the meantime Michel Christol has discussed the date in a paper on imperial movements in the years 256-8, and that has necessitated some modification of the commentary (<bibl>
                  <series>Cahiers Glotz</series> 8 (<date>1997</date>), 249-52, whence <series>SEG</series> 47.1544</bibl>).</p>
            <p>a. ll. 2-7: The names of Valerian and Gallienus can be satisfactorily restored as those in use at their accessions in A.D. 253. Gallienus' additional <foreign xml:lang="la">nomen</foreign>, Egnatius, does not appear in its usual place, but it was very commonly omitted. There are also no titles of office, nor of victory. This is explained by Christol as due to excision by an editor; but since all the inscribed copies of imperial letters that I know lack the titles of office, and almost all of them the titles of victory, the omissions may relate to the category of letter - these titles being felt inappropriate to the fiction that they were man to man correspondence. Since the titles do appear in one letter of this category (Syll.3 883, <persName key="Caracalla" type="emperor" reg="Caracalla" full="yes">Caracalla</persName> to <persName type="other" key="iulianus" full="yes">Aurelius Julianus</persName>), I felt in 1989 that their omission could be significant, and if so possibly relevant to the date. But since they are omitted in the only other known letter of Valerian and Gallienus to an individual, I no longer believe that it is at all likely to be significant here. The absence of the younger Valerian as Caesar should also be observed, but I had already said in 1989 that he was not regularly included with his grandfather and father before 257; Christol shows that he was not in fact treated as sharing the imperial power to issue regulations unless perhaps in the very last months of his life at the end of 257 and early in 258.</p>
            <p>a. l. 8. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαίρειν</foreign> can be restored at the end of the line since <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρρωσο</foreign> in b, l.5, shows that the document is a letter. The recipient cannot be identified from his <term xml:lang="la">nomen</term> alone, but the space available after that and before the greeting is probably too small to contain a title as well as a <term xml:lang="la">cognomen</term>; he is unlikely, therefore, to have been a Roman official. Individual recipients of imperial letters are, however, all of high standing, and since it is arguable that he was not himself an Aphrodisian (see on a, ll.9, 17-18), it seems worth suggesting that he may have been a <term xml:lang="la">
                  <rs reg="curator reipublicae" key="curatrep" type="official-secul">curator reipublicae</rs>
               </term>. If so, his concern will have been with some aspect of the city's public finances. Problems might arise over these at any time; but in the aftermath of the creation of the new province of <placeName key="cariaphrygia" reg="Caria and Phrygia" n="admin" full="yes">Caria and Phrygia</placeName> (See discussion at <ref type="eAla-text" n="I.2" target=".xml"/>) there are likely to have been a series of them, arising from the need to reconcile old privileges with new obligations.</p>
            <p>a. ll. 9-11. The space in l. 11 should indicate the end of a sentence. It is probable that its main verb partly survives in ll. 9-10, where something like <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                  <supplied cert="low" reason="lost">οἰόμε</supplied>θα</foreign> may be suggested, with the subsequent infinitive in dependence; the emperors presumably indicated their view that someone (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοὺσ τ<supplied cert="low" reason="lost">οὺς Ἀφροδισιεῖς</supplied>
               </foreign>) ought—or ought not—to behave in a specified way. If the Aphrodisians did appear here (and perhaps again in ll. 17-18), it seems improbable that the recipient was himself an Aphrodisian (see also on l .8), or at any rate was acting in his capacity as such.</p>
            <p>a. l. 12. The conclusion of a verb in the infinitive is clear, but several words could be restored, some giving opposite meanings (e.g. <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαρύνειν, λαμπρύνειν</foreign>).</p>
            <p>a. ll. 13-22. There is no clue here sufficient to indicate the sense; the Aphrodisians are perhaps named in ll. 17-18, and it may be that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινῶν</foreign> stood in ll. 18-19, possibly then carrying a reference to a<rs type="subject" key="koinon"> common festival of a province</rs>, whether of Asia or of Caria and Phrygia.</p>
            <p>b, l. 2. There might be a reference to a letter (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστολή</foreign>) sent, perhaps, to the Aphrodisians themselves.</p>
            <p>b. l. 3. The second word must be a participle (<seg cert="low">
                  <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐηγούμενοι</foreign>
               </seg>).</p>
            <p>b. l. 4. What survives suggests that the emperors may have given the banal assurance that they would uphold civic privileges granted in the past (for a parallel cf. <ref type="inscription" n="525" target="080114.xml"/>, ll. 11-14).</p>
            <p>b. l. 6. The day and month are <date precision="circa">twenty-third August</date>. In the chancellery's file a consular date, giving the year, presumably stood at the head of the set of documents of which this was one; whether it was transferred to the copy of each document as it was sent out is not clear.</p>
            <p>For the place from which the letter was written I have found no restoration to propose except <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀγριππείνῃ</foreign>, which I take to be Cologne—<placeName reg="Cologne" key="cologne" full="yes" xml:lang="la">Colonia Claudia Arae Agrippinensis (Agrippinensium)</placeName>, whose name was naturally enough shortened in everyday use, and appears in Zonaras' account of this period as <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀγριππίνη</foreign> (Zon. 12. 24). If the restoration is accepted, the text provides the earliest known example of the usage. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἐν</foreign> with the dative to describe the place of writing is normal for imperial edicts and subscripts, but after the first century A.D., emperors all seem to prefer <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπό</foreign> with the genitive for letters; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν</foreign> here might indicate that Valerian was detached from his regular secretariat when he wrote this letter (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπό</foreign> appears for his letter to the Philadelphians written in <date value="255" precision="circa">255</date> at <placeName key="Antioch" full="yes">Antioch</placeName>, <bibl n="seg">
                  <title level="j">SEG</title> XXVII. 528</bibl>). </p>
            <p>It is generally agreed that Cologne was the headquarters of Gallienus in 257, and it is has recently been argued that he had already moved there in 256, but hitherto there has been no indication that Valerian ever went there after he became emperor. Correspondence concerning the eastern part of the empire, however, would surely never have been referred to Gallienus before Valerian's capture by the Parthians in 260, since Valerian was not only the senior emperor, but had taken personal command in the east. This letter, if written from Cologne, must imply a visit by Valerian to Cologne. The date of this visit is not immediately clear. In 1989 I thought that a case could be made for 254 and a better one for 256; but Christol now argues that both are excluded and 257 the only possible year. This is of course a period for which we have a very limited number of assured dates, and for the most part must be content with probabilities. It is entirely likely that Valerian went to the east soon after his accession, although he is not actually attested there before 10th January 255 (<bibl n="seg">
                  <title level="j">SEG</title> 18.528</bibl>), and that he was fully occupied with problems there, above all with Persian aggression, for some time. That programme could reasonably be supposed to exclude a visit to Cologne in 254 or 256. On the other hand, successes by Valerian against Parthia and by Gallienus against the Germans were celebrated at the beginning of <date value="257">257</date> in <placeName key="Rome" full="yes">Rome</placeName>, where both emperors apparently began their joint consulates on 1st January. That both went subsequently to Cologne (where the German threat remained real) would be comprehensible. Defence works at Cologne are attributed to the period, including a gate with an inscription in which the city has the titles '<foreign xml:lang="la">
                  <supplied cert="low" reason="lost">Valerian</supplied>a Galliena</foreign>' (<bibl>
                  <title level="s">CIL</title> XIII. 8261</bibl>, in which the first title is at least very probable); and their joint assumption of the title <rs reg="Germanicus" key="germanicus" type="dignity">Germanicus</rs> in the same year would fit neatly into this context. This may well be the right date for the visit. Whether it is or not, the inscription suggests a rather more vigorous approach to the problems of empire than is commonly attributed to Valerian.</p>
